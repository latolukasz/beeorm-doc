# CRUD Operations

All reads and writes go through the generated code described in [Code Generation](/guide/code_generation.html): the provider loads and creates entities, the entity records what you change, and the `Context` persists it. There is no unit-of-work to flush at the end of a request — `ctx.Save` writes exactly the entities you pass and nothing else.

The examples use the `model.CategoryEntity` / `model.UserEntity` structs from the code generation page, generated into a package `entities`, with the `enums` package next to it:

```go
import (
    "context"

    "github.com/latolukasz/fluxaorm/v2"

    "myapp/entities"
    "myapp/entities/enums"
)

ctx := engine.NewContext(context.Background())
```

## Creating entities

`Provider.New(ctx)` returns a new entity with its ID already assigned:

```go
category := entities.CategoryEntityProvider.New(ctx)
category.SetCode("books").SetName("Books")

user := entities.UserEntityProvider.New(ctx)
user.SetName("Alice").
    SetEmail("alice@example.com").
    SetStatus(enums.UserStatusList.Active).
    SetCategory(category.GetID())

err := ctx.Save(category, user)
```

- The ID comes from `ctx.Engine().NextID()`, an in-process snowflake generator (41 bits of milliseconds since 2024-01-01, 11 bits of node, 11 bits of sequence). It needs neither Redis nor MySQL and never fails, which is why `New` returns only `*Entity`. Because the ID exists before the INSERT, you can reference a new entity from another one (`SetCategory(category.GetID())`) and save both in one call. When several processes create rows of the same table, give each one a distinct node with `engine.SetNodeID(node int64)`; see [Engine](/guide/engine.html).
- The new entity is put into the [context cache](/guide/context_cache.html) immediately, so `GetByID` on the same context returns the same pointer even before it is saved.
- Required `enum` and `set` fields start with their first declared value; everything else starts as the Go zero value (NULL for nullable columns).
- Nothing is written until `ctx.Save`.

`Provider.NewWithID(ctx, id)` does the same with an ID you choose.

## Setters and dirty tracking

Setters return the entity, so calls chain. On a new entity a setter simply writes the value. On a loaded entity it compares the value with what was read from MySQL or Redis: an identical value is a no-op (and undoes an earlier change to the same column), a different value is recorded in the entity's change set. Only recorded columns end up in the `UPDATE` statement.

```go
user, found, err := entities.UserEntityProvider.GetByID(ctx, id)
user.SetName("Alice")          // no-op if Name already is "Alice"
user.SetEmail("")              // nullable string: "" stores NULL
user.SetName(user.GetName())   // undoes a pending Name change
```

Floats are compared after rounding to the column's precision, times are truncated to the second (`orm:"time"`) or to the day (date columns) before comparison and storage. There is no validation of `required` fields on save: `required` only decides whether a column is `NOT NULL`; saving a required string as `""` is allowed.

## Saving

```go
Save(entities ...Entity) error
```

`Save` writes the entities you pass, in the order you pass them. A clean entity (no changes, not new, not deleted) is a no-op, duplicates of the same pointer are collapsed, and `nil` entries are skipped. Passing a single entity executes its statement directly; passing **more than one** wraps the write in a [transaction](/guide/transactions.html) automatically, so entities that belong together commit together. Inside an explicit `ctx.Transaction` every `Save` joins that transaction.

What happens, in order:

1. For each entity the generated code runs the `Before*` [callbacks](/guide/lifecycle_callbacks.html), builds its `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` into the database pipeline of its pool, registers the Redis keys the write makes stale and queues Redis Search hash writes. `CreatedAt` and `UpdatedAt` are set to `time.Now().UTC().Truncate(time.Second)` on insert (only when still zero, so a value you set yourself is kept), and `UpdatedAt` is refreshed on every update.
2. The registered Redis keys are deleted (see [Redis Cache](/guide/redis_cache.html)).
3. The SQL statements run — through the open transaction when there is one, otherwise directly on the pool. A SQL error is returned as-is and nothing below happens.
4. Post-commit work runs once the rows are durable: the same Redis keys are deleted a second time, Redis pipelines (search hashes) execute, [entity events](/guide/entity_events.html) are published, `After*` handlers run, deleted entities leave the context cache, and finally every entity folds its change set into its origin values. Inside a transaction this step is deferred until `COMMIT`.

After a successful `Save` the same pointer is clean, `new` is false, and it stays in the context cache: keep using it, change it, save it again.

```go
user.SetName("Alice Smith")
err = ctx.Save(user) // UPDATE `UserEntity` SET `Name`=?,`UpdatedAt`=? WHERE `ID`=<id>
```

Errors you can get from `Save`:

- the SQL error of the failing statement (rows not written; inside a transaction the transaction is rolled back);
- `entity <type> <id> belongs to a different context; save it on the context that created or loaded it` — an entity can only be saved on the `Context` that created or loaded it;
- `*fluxaorm.PostCommitError` — a step of the post-commit phase failed **after** the rows were committed. Do not retry the write; see [Transactions](/guide/transactions.html).

There is no API to discard pending changes: drop the handle, or `ctx.Reload` it (which refuses while changes are pending, see below).

## Reading

### GetByID

```go
user, found, err := entities.UserEntityProvider.GetByID(ctx, 12345)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
if !found {
    return errors.New("user does not exist")
}
fmt.Println(user.GetName())
```

`GetByID` consults, in this order:

1. the [context cache](/guide/context_cache.html) of `ctx` — a hit returns the very pointer you already hold;
2. the [Redis row cache](/guide/redis_cache.html), when the entity has `orm:"redisCache"` and `ctx` is **not** inside a transaction — a negative entry (row known to be missing) returns `found == false` without touching MySQL;
3. MySQL: `SELECT <all columns> FROM <table> WHERE ID = ? LIMIT 1` through `ctx.DB(pool)`, so inside a transaction the read sees that transaction's writes. The result (or a negative entry) is written to the Redis row cache and the entity is put in the context cache.

`GetByID` returns [fake-deleted](/guide/fake_delete.html) rows.

### MustGetByID

```go
user, err := entities.UserEntityProvider.MustGetByID(ctx, 12345)
```

Same as `GetByID` without the `found` flag: a missing row **panics** with `UserEntity with id 12345 not found`. Errors are still returned. Use it where a missing row is a programming error, not user input.

### GetByIDs

```go
users, err := entities.UserEntityProvider.GetByIDs(ctx, 3, 1, 2, 1)
```

Returns the found entities in the order of the (de-duplicated) input, silently skipping ids that do not exist — the result may be shorter than the input. Ids already in the context cache are served from it; the rest are looked up in the Redis row cache with one pipelined round trip (outside transactions), and whatever is still missing is loaded with a single `SELECT ... WHERE ID IN (...)`. Every loaded row is written to both caches; ids that turn out not to exist get a negative cache entry.

### Searching

`SearchOne`, `SearchMany`, `SearchManyWithTotal` and `Count` take a `*fluxaorm.DBQuery` built from the provider's `Fields` descriptors. They select ids only and then hydrate through `GetByIDs`, so search results also come from and go into the context cache. They are documented in [Search](/guide/search.html); full-text and numeric search in Redis in [Redis Search](/guide/redis_search.html).

```go
users, total, err := entities.UserEntityProvider.SearchManyWithTotal(ctx,
    fluxaorm.NewQuery().
        Filter(entities.UserEntityProvider.Fields.Status.Is(enums.UserStatusList.Active)).
        SortByASC(entities.UserEntityProvider.Fields.Name).
        Pager(fluxaorm.NewPager(1, 20)),
)
```

## Updating

Load, change, save. Every entity returned by `GetByID`, `GetByIDs` or a `Search*` method can be saved on the context it came from:

```go
users, err := entities.UserEntityProvider.SearchMany(ctx,
    fluxaorm.NewQuery().Filter(entities.UserEntityProvider.Fields.Category.Eq(oldCategoryID)),
)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
saveList := make([]fluxaorm.Entity, len(users))
for i, user := range users {
    user.SetCategory(newCategoryID)
    saveList[i] = user
}
err = ctx.Save(saveList...) // one transaction, one UPDATE per changed user
```

The generated `UPDATE` lists only the changed columns and addresses the row by its literal id: ``UPDATE `UserEntity` SET `Category`=?,`UpdatedAt`=? WHERE `ID`=12345``.

## Deleting

```go
Delete(entities ...Entity) error
ForceDelete(entities ...Entity) error
```

Both write immediately (they call `Save` internally, so several entities are deleted in one transaction and the same post-commit steps run):

```go
user, found, err := entities.UserEntityProvider.GetByID(ctx, 12345)
if err != nil || !found {
    return err
}
err = ctx.Delete(user) // DELETE FROM `UserEntity` WHERE `ID` = ?
```

- `Delete` honours [fake delete](/guide/fake_delete.html): on an entity with a `FakeDelete` field it issues an `UPDATE` that marks the row deleted instead of removing it.
- `ForceDelete` always removes the row. On an entity without `FakeDelete` it behaves exactly like `Delete`.
- Deleting an entity that was never saved fails with `ErrEntityNotPersisted` (`entity was never persisted: *entities.UserEntity 12345`).
- After the write the entity is removed from the context cache, so a later `GetByID` on the same context goes to the database (and, for a hard delete, returns not found). Saving the deleted entity again does not re-issue the `DELETE`.

## Reloading

```go
Reload(entities ...Entity) error
```

`Reload` re-reads each entity from MySQL **in place**: the pointer does not change, so every holder of that entity — including the context cache — sees the fresh row. It always reads MySQL (never the Redis row cache) through `ctx.DB(pool)`, so inside a transaction it sees the transaction's own writes. A reloaded entity is clean, and setters afterwards compare against the new values.

```go
if err := ctx.Reload(user); err != nil {
    switch {
    case errors.Is(err, fluxaorm.ErrEntityUnsavedChanges):
        // save or drop the pending changes first
    case errors.Is(err, fluxaorm.ErrEntityVanished):
        // the row was deleted by someone else
    default:
        return err
    }
}
```

Entities are processed in order and the first failure stops the loop. Errors are wrapped as `reload entity <id>: <cause>`:

| Error | Meaning |
|:------|:--------|
| `ErrEntityNotPersisted` | The entity is new; there is no row to read. |
| `ErrEntityUnsavedChanges` | The entity has pending setter changes. Reloading would silently discard them, so it is refused before any query runs. |
| `ErrEntityVanished` | The row no longer exists in MySQL. |

## Error reference

| Variable | Text | Returned by |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| `fluxaorm.ErrEntityNotPersisted` | `entity was never persisted` | `Delete`, `ForceDelete`, `Reload` |
| `fluxaorm.ErrEntityUnsavedChanges` | `entity has unsaved changes` | `Reload` |
| `fluxaorm.ErrEntityVanished` | `entity row no longer exists` | `Reload` |
| `fluxaorm.ErrTxRollbackOnly` | `transaction is rollback-only` | `Transaction` (see [Transactions](/guide/transactions.html)) |
| `*fluxaorm.PostCommitError` | `post-commit failure (database changes are committed): <cause>` | `Save`, `Delete`, `ForceDelete`, `Transaction` |

All of them are matched with `errors.Is` / `errors.As` through the wrapping.

::: tip One context per unit of work
An entity belongs to the `Context` that created or loaded it and can only be saved there. Create a `Context` per request or job, and use `ctx.Clone()` when you need an independent unit of work with its own [context cache](/guide/context_cache.html); see [Context](/guide/context.html).
